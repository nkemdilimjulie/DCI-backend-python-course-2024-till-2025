    "- In Postgresql, we have two types of functions\n",
    "    - Aggregate functions\n",
    "    - Non-aggregate functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Functions\n",
    "> Aggregate functions are functions that can take multiple values from a table, and return a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the aggregate functions are \n",
    "- SUM() -> `Return the sum of a set of numbers`\n",
    "- COUNT() -> `Returns the count of rows`\n",
    "- MAX() -> `Returns the maximum, or largest row`\n",
    "- MIN() -> `Returns the minimum, or smallest row`\n",
    "- AVG() -> `Returns the average of a set of numbers`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### COUNT\n",
    "- Let's get the number of rows in our table\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- get all books\n",

    "\n",
    "-- Return the count\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book;\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(isbn) FROM book;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- To get the number of rows in a table, we use `COUNT` with either `*` or any column.\n",
    "    - But we need to make sure that column has the `NOT NULL` constraints.\n",
    "    - The Primary key is a very good candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MAX\n",
    "- Works with numbers\n",
    "- Also works with strings(uses the unicode code of each character )\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- What is the highest page count of books\n",

    "\n",
    "- Whenever you have aggregate(columns in the aggregate function) and non-aggregate columns, all non-aggregate should be mentioned in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n",
    "- The `GROUP BY` is optional if we have only aggregates in the `SELECT` clause\n",
    "\n",

    "- We have two filters `WHERE` and `HAVING`\n",

    "GROUP BY category, format\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) % 2 = 0; \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion** If you want to filter by the result of an aggregate, then the `HAVING` is the best choice. But remember that the `HAVING` doesn't support alias. So, you will have to use the aggregate function directly in the `HAVING`.\n",

    "### Some important points to understand\n",
    "- The subquery is also known as `INNER QUERY`, and the query enclosing it is called `OUTER QUERY`.\n",
    "- The subquery  run first (partially or completely).\n",
    "- The subquery should be enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "- The subquery may need to have an alias (or may not)\n",
    "- The subquery doesn't end with a semi-colon\n",
    "- The return value(single or multiple columns) depend on the outer query.\n",
    "\n",
