### 1. Statements
- **Definition**: A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. It performs an action but does not necessarily produce a value.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Statements do not return a value; they are executed to perform some operation.
  - Statements can span multiple lines (e.g., `if` statements, `for` loops).
    - Examples of statements include:
    - **Assignment statement**: `x = 5`
    - **Control flow statement**: `if x > 0:`
    - **Loop statement**: `for i in range(10):`
    - **Function definition**: `def my_function():`


### 2. Expressions

- **Definition**: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. An expression always returns a value.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Expressions are meant to be evaluated to produce a value.
  - An expression can be a part of a statement.

  - Examples of expressions include:
    - **Arithmetic expression**: `2 + 3`
    - **Function call**: `my_function()`
    - **Boolean expression**: `x > 0`
    - **Complex expression**: `(x * 2) + (y / 3)`

### Summary
- **Statements**: Perform actions and are executed by the interpreter. They do not return a value (e.g., `x = 5`, `if x > 0:`).
- **Expressions**: Produce a value when evaluated (e.g., `2 + 3`, `x > 0`).
