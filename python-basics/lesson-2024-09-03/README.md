### 1. **Introduction to Recursive Functions**

**Definition:**
A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive functions break down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, until they reach a base case, which can be solved directly.

**Structure of a Recursive Function:**
A recursive function typically has two parts:
- **Base Case:** The condition under which the recursion ends.
- **Recursive Case:** The part where the function calls itself with a modified argument, moving towards the base case.
