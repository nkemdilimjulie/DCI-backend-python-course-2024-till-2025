#### **Function Definition:**
A function in Python is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.

#### **Benefits of Using Functions:**
- **Code Reusability:** Functions allow you to reuse code, avoiding repetition.

- **Modularity:** Functions help in organizing code into modules, making it easier to manage and understand.

- **Improved Readability:** By using descriptive function names, the code becomes more readable.

- **Easier Debugging:** Errors can be isolated within functions, simplifying the debugging process.

- **Collaboration:** Functions allow multiple developers to work on different parts of a program simultaneously.
