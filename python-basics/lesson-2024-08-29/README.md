### **1. Understanding Decorators in Python**

#### **What Is a Decorator?**
A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of a function or method without changing its code. Decorators are functions that take another function as an argument, add some functionality, and return a new function.

#### **Usage Scenarios for Decorators:**

- **Logging:** Automatically log function calls, arguments, and results.
- **Authorization:** Restrict access to certain functions based on user permissions.
- **Caching:** Cache the results of expensive function calls to improve performance
- **Timing:** Measure the execution time of a function for performance analysis.
