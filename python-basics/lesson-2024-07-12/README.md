### 1. Bits and Bytes

**Bits:**
- A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in computing, and it can have a value of either 0 or 1.

- Bits are the basic building blocks of digital communication and storage.

**Bytes:**

- A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits.

- Bytes are used to represent a wide variety of data, including characters (letters, numbers, symbols), and can represent values from 0 to 255 (in binary: 00000000 to 11111111).

### 2. Metric Prefixes: KB, MB, GB, etc.

Metric prefixes are used to denote large quantities of bytes:

- **Kilobyte (KB)**: 1 KB = 1024 bytes (Note: While the SI unit system uses 1000, computing often uses powers of 2, hence 1024).

- **Megabyte (MB)**: 1 MB = 1024 KB = 1,048,576 bytes.

- **Gigabyte (GB)**: 1 GB = 1024 MB = 1,073,741,824 bytes.

- **Terabyte (TB)**: 1 TB = 1024 GB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes.

- **Petabyte (PB)**: 1 PB = 1024 TB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes.


### 3. Number Systems and Binary

**Number Systems:**
- Different bases are used in computing for various purposes:

- **Decimal (Base 10)**: The standard number system used in everyday life, consisting of digits 0-9.

- **Binary (Base 2)**: Used internally by virtually all modern computers and digital systems. It consists of only two digits: 0 and 1.

- Binary is used because digital devices have two states (on/off, true/false), which map naturally to 0 and 1.

- Operations at the hardware level, such as memory access and arithmetic operations, are performed using binary.
