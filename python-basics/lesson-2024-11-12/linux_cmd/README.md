# Building Linux Commands in Python

## ls command
Create a short program, a bit similar to the `ls` command in linux.
- `ls` will be our program
- arguments will be the directory to use our program on.

**NB**: Using sys.argv to build this CLI

#### Important processes
- When we run the program without an argument, the current working directory is considered.
- When an argument(directory) is given, it will list all contents of that directory
- This command doesn't have subcommands
- We will exclude hidden files and folders by default.
