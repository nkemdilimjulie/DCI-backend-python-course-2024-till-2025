### **1. Understanding Lambda Functions in Python**

#### **What Is a Lambda Function?**
A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions are single-line functions that don't require a name and can have any number of arguments but only one expression.

#### **Syntax of a Lambda Function:**

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

- **Arguments:** The inputs to the function (just like in a regular function).

- **Expression:** A single expression that is evaluated and returned.
