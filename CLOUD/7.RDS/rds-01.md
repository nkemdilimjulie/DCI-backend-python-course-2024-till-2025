# Cloud - RDS - 01: Intro

**Introduction:**
- Relational Database Service (RDS)
- is a fully managed relational database service
    - reduction operational cost
- It makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud, offering automation for many tasks
    1. backups
    2. database scaling
- supports several popular database engines:
    1. MySQL
    2. PostgreSQL
    3. Oracle
    4. MariaDB
    5. Microsoft SQL Server

- **Simplified Database Management**
- **Scalability**
    - with just a few clicks you can scale:
        1. vertically (increasing compute or memory capacity)
        2. horizontally (adding read replicas)
- **High Availability**:
    - RDS provides options for Multi-AZ (multiple availability zones) deployments
- **Security**:
    - RDS integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and offers encryption at rest and in transit, enabling strong security practices.
- **Automatic Backups**:
    - RDS automatically performs backups, allows for point-in-time recovery, and retains data based on a specified retention period.
- **Cost Efficiency**: You pay for only what you use, leveraging RDS' ability to scale resources up and down as required.
