**Last Session**

- Elasticity: increase and resize back capacities (e.g. EC2)  
- Scalability: scale up if needed

- Serverless Service:
    - AWS Lambda
        - we can store here python functions
        - pay as demanded: you pay only for requests and the time the function runs
        - use case: create restful api with APIgateway service and a database service (Dynamo DB)
            - or you can store a Text file on AWS (storing service S3) and could e.g. count words of this file
                - and you could send the counted words via SMS (SNS Service) 
         
- EC2
    - what setting and configurations can we set:
        - OS (option between Linux; Mac OS and Windows systems)
        - Instance Types: t2.micro
            - Price range per hour: ~0,004$ - ~4,000 $
        - you can use Permission keys: and we can use them for ssh login from our terminal
        - Security Groups: Firewall for specific ports
